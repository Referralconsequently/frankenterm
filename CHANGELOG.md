## [Unreleased] -- development on `main` since 2026-02-17

> ~3,500 commits since the `backup-before-rewrite` tag. Active daily development by concurrent agent swarms. The project grew from a WezTerm automation wrapper to a full terminal platform with its own GUI, mux server, and 120-crate workspace (~775k lines of code, 45,000+ tests).

### WezTerm Source Import & FrankenTerm Identity (2026-02-10)

Imported WezTerm source at commit `05343b38` and integrated it as owned code within the workspace. Renamed the project from `wezterm_automata`/`wa` to `frankenterm`/`ft`. All CLI commands, module names, config paths, and documentation updated.

### BREAKING: Remove Lua-based status update hook (2026-01-28)

Removed `update-status` Lua callback that fired at ~60Hz, causing continuous overhead. Alt-screen detection now via escape sequence parsing. Pane metadata via polling only when needed.

- [Remove Lua status update hook for performance](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenterm/commit/ff24bb3f23be958f5fec88725ceb8aebb819d9aa)
- [Remove StatusUpdateReceived event variant](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/frankenterm/commit/ee66abdf20bfb90d8e0d99117fdcf5b19f8b66ac)

Migration: re-run `ft setup --wezterm` to update your `wezterm.lua`. The ft-managed block should no longer contain `wezterm.on('update-status'`, `wa_last_status_update`, or `WA_STATUS_UPDATE_INTERVAL_MS`. It should still contain `wezterm.on('user-var-changed'` for agent signaling.
