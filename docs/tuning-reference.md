# Tuning Reference

`TuningConfig` is loaded from the `[tuning]` section of `ft.toml`. Every key is optional. If you omit a key, `ft` keeps the hard-coded default from `crates/frankenterm-core/src/tuning_config.rs`.

This reference is for operators tuning live fleets. The ranges below are starting points, not promises. Change one subsystem at a time, run `ft config validate`, then watch capture lag, queue depth, SQLite lock timing, memory pressure, search latency, and workflow completion time before moving further.

Before you tune a live deployment:

- For current rollout posture, hardware-tier defaults, and fallback guidance, start with `docs/resize-user-facing-release-tuning-guidance-wa-1u90p.8.5.md`.
- For incident triage and rollback flow, use `docs/operator-playbook.md`.
- Treat this file as the knob-level reference, not the release-posture document.

## Sizing Profiles

- `10 panes`: small local swarm or single-operator setup where low latency matters more than peak throughput.
- `50 panes`: medium fleet. In most cases this is the baseline profile and the default settings are already appropriate.
- `200+ panes`: long-running, high-concurrency fleet where queue stability, memory headroom, and API fan-out matter more than shaving the last few milliseconds off every loop.

## `[tuning.runtime]`

These keys live under `[tuning.runtime]`.

| Field | Default | Unit | What it controls / when to change it | 10 panes | 50 panes | 200+ panes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `output_coalesce_window_ms` | `50` | ms | How long the runtime batches short output bursts before processing. Lower it for lower latency; raise it when bursty fleets create too many tiny writes. | `25-50` | `50-75` | `75-150` |

## Practical Tuning Order

If you are tuning a live deployment and do not know where to start, use this order:

1. `runtime` and `backpressure`: capture latency, batching, and early pressure warnings.
2. `patterns`: dedup and anchor context once you understand rule volume.
3. `policy` and `web`: API fan-out and fleet-control ceilings.
4. `search`: only after you have measured indexing pressure and query behavior.
5. `workflows` and nested CASS sections: only if automation descriptors or context injection are clearly the bottleneck.
6. `wezterm`, `wire_protocol`, and `ipc`: only when backend or transport diagnostics point there.

The default configuration is intentionally conservative. For most fleets, the right first move is to leave most keys alone and adjust only the small set of knobs tied to the subsystem that is already showing stress.
